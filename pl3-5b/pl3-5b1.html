				<h3>Announcing the Android Basics in Kotlin Course</h3>
				<h4>Posted by Murat Yener, Developer Advocate</h4>
				<p> We are always looking for ways to make learning Android development accessible for all. In 2020, we announced the launch of <strong>Android Basics in Kotlin</strong>, a free self-paced programming course. Since then, over 100,000 beginners have completed their first milestone in the course.</br>Android Basics in Kotlin teaches people with no programming experience how to build simple Android apps. Along the way, students learn the fundamentals of programming and the basics of the Kotlin programming language. <em>Today, weâ€™re excited to share that the final unit has been released, and the full Android Basics in Kotlin course is now available</em></p>

				<h4>by Admin MindOrks</h4>
				<p>If you are reading this blog, then we are pretty sure that either you have totally shifted to Kotlin for Android Development or you are planning to move to Kotlin very soon. In any of the cases, this blog is a perfect match for you. So, let's get to the point.In our Android application, we deal with various collections such as lists, maps, sets, etc. We perform many operations on these, but do you know there are many Kotlin Collection Functions, that can make our life easier. There is a high probability that if you are want to perform some operation(simple or complex) on any collection, then there must be some collection function that will make your whole Android App development simpler and easier.</p>
